# Deadpool for synchroneous code [![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/deadpool-sync.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/deadpool-sync) ![Unsafe forbidden](https://img.shields.io/badge/unsafe-forbidden-success.svg "Unsafe forbidden") [![Rust 1.63+](https://img.shields.io/badge/rustc-1.63+-lightgray.svg "Rust 1.63+")](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/08/11/Rust-1.63.0.html)

Deadpool is a dead simple async pool for connections and objects
of any type.

This crates provides helpers for writing pools for objects that don't
support async and need to be run inside a thread.

**Note:** This crate is intended for making the development of
`deadpool-*` crates easier. Other libraries and binary projects
normally should not use this directly and use some provided
reexports by the crates using it.

## Features

| Feature | Description | Extra dependencies | Default |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------------ | ------- |
| `tracing` | Enable support for [tracing](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing) by propagating Spans in the `interact()` calls. Enable this if you use the `tracing` crate and you want to get useful traces from within `interact()` calls. | `tracing` | no |
